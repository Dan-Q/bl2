        <h1>Welcome to BodLanes</h1>
        <p>
          This presentation is designed to be viewed at exactly 1920 &times; 1080 pixels, which is fullscreen (F11) on a
          horizontally-oritented "full HD" monitor. You can simulate this in a modern web browser like Google
          Chrome using the Dev Tools. BodLanes presentations are HTML files enhanced with special <code>&lt;bl-*&gt;</code>
          tags to represent special kinds of content and are suitable for deployment to web-technology-powered digital
          signage and kiosks.

          can do, or make your own presentation in the presentations folder by creating a folder and index.html file there,
          e.g. <code>presentations/my-presentation/index.html</code>.

      <h1>
        Fourth Page
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page 'identifies as' the third page, so the menu still shows that we're on the third page. This is
        useful for pages that are clear 'children' of others, such as in galleries with additional information
        about each item.

      <p>
        There's also a <code>&lt;bl-floater&gt;</code> on this page: a block type that can be positioned anywhere
        you like: in this case, it's being used to put the "back" button in the top right corner. Give it a click!

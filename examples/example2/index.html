        fontawesome icons, and the updating of multiple <code>&lt;bl-container&gt;</code>s at once, this
        presentation contains tips on creating and deploying presentations using BodLanes2.

      <h1>Editing presentations</h1>
      <p>
        Presentations are folders in the <code>presentations</code> folder (or in the case of this one, the
        <code>examples</code> folder), e.g. <code>presentations/my-presentation</code>. As a minimum, they
        should contain an <code>index.html</code> file: this is a standard HTML5 file (although you'll
        probably want to add a few special elements that you might not yet be familiar with).
      </p>
      <bl-grid columns="539px 1fr" gap="50px">
        <img src="security-questions.gif">
        <div>
          <p>
            Some common special elements are:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <code>&lt;bl-template&gt;</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Wraps your template - the 'layout' of your presentation.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              <code>&lt;bl-container&gt;</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Defines areas of a template into which content can be loaded.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              <code>&lt;bl-content&gt;</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A container for content blocks to load into the template. Content blocks
              themselves are regular HTML elements with an <code>id</code> attribute.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              <code>&lt;bl-grid&gt;</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              An abstraction of CSS grids suitable for easy creation.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              <code>&lt;bl-menu&gt;</code>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A mechanism for organising links into a horizontal or vertical list.
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </div>
      </bl-grid>
    </bl-padded-block>

    <bl-padded-block id="edit-tools">
      <h1>Tools &amp; Workflow</h1>
      <p>
        Optionally run a webserver with: <code>npm start</code>. You can then view your presentation by pointing
        your web browser at e.g. http://localhost:8080/presentations/my-presentation. Using a webserver means
        that you can also allow others on your network to see your presentations (simply replace 'localhost' with
        the IP address of your computer) and use advanced features like Google Analytics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, simply open the file (e.g. <code>presentations/my-presentation/index.html</code>) directly
        in your web browser. Either way, Google Chrome is probably the best bet for a consistent look-and-feel,
        and is technically similar to many of the recommended deployment solutions. Chrome also provides screen
        size simulation via the Device Toolbar, which can help to accurately simulate how a presentation will appear
        on your real signage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edit the file in your favourite text editor e.g. Sublime Text or directly in Chrome itself (debugger &gt;
        Sources &gt; Filesystem, add your presentation folder to the project: changes can now be made from within
        the browser itself). Refresh periodically to see your changes: under normal circumstances, you'll carry on
        seeing the content blocks where you left off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Store any additional files (custom CSS, images, etc.) in your <code>presentation</code> folder, or put it into the
        <code>extensions</code> folder if it'll be useful across multiple presentations (consider committing it back
        to GitHub to share with the world, if it might enjoy wider use!)
      </p>

    <!-- content blocks relating to the deploy section -->
    <bl-padded-block id="deploy-intro">
      <h1>Deployment</h1>
      <p>
        BodLanes presentations are designed to be able to be deployed either via the web (to mobile, desktop, or kiosk
        clients anywhere, via a web browser), to kiosks as static offline HTML, or as desktop applications via NW.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        To begin a deployment, run:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          npm run build<br>
          npm run compile presentations/my-presentation
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your compiled presentation will be placed in <code>output/presentations/my-presentation</code>.
      </p>
    </bl-padded-block>

    <bl-padded-block id="deploy-browser">
      <h1>Deployment to Browsers</h1>
      <p>
        Deploy the folder to a web server and point browsers at the
        <code>presentations/my-presentation/presentations/my-presentation/index.html</code> file.
        <code>presentations/my-presentation/index.html</code> will redirect, if you prefer.</p>
      <p>
        Browsers can in this case be kiosks or desktops as described elsewhere in this presentation,
        and this can be a good way to remotely manage content as well as to easily integrate with online
        services such as Google Analytics.
      </p>
    </bl-padded-block>

    <bl-padded-block id="deploy-kiosk">
      <h1>Deployment to Kiosks</h1>
      <p>
        Deploy the folder to the kiosk and point the kiosk browser software at the
        <code>presentations/my-presentation/presentations/my-presentation/index.html</code> file.
      </p>
    </bl-padded-block>

    <bl-padded-block id="deploy-desktop">
      <h1>Deployment to Desktops</h1>
      <p>
        Install NW.js. In the <code>output/presentations/my-presentation</code> folder (or a deployed)
        copy of it, run:
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>nw .</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Alternatively, run e.g. <code>nw output/presentations/my-presentation</code>.)

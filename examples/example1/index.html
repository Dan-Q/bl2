        <h1>Welcome to BodLanes</h1>
        <p>
          This presentation is designed to be viewed at exactly 1920 &times; 1080 pixels, which is fullscreen (F11) on a
          horizontally-oritented "full HD" monitor. You can simulate this in a modern web browser like Google
          Chrome using the Dev Tools. BodLanes presentations are HTML files enhanced with special <code>&lt;bl-*&gt;</code>
          tags to represent special kinds of content and are suitable for deployment to web-technology-powered digital
          signage and kiosks.
